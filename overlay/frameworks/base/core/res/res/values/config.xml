         allowed to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is
         active.  This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't make voice calls and don't support any in-call UI.
         Note: this flag is subtly different from the
         PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY system feature, which is
         available on *any* device with a telephony radio, even if the

         which can't send and receive sms message.

               cell broadcasting sms, and MMS. -->

         app requesting portrait will cause a counter-clockwise rotation.  Setting
